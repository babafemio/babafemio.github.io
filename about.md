Hello there! I'm Babafemi Ogungbamila. I am an engineer at heart and have spent over two decades building systems and leading engineering and technology teams to build platforms that power the most critical payment infrastructures.

### Bio
I started my career at Interswitch as an interface engineer, deploying payment infrastructure banks. Software engineering has always been my passion, so I started the software engineering competence at the company and subsequently took charge of the software development team. I later served as the Chief Information Officer, overseeing both software engineering and infrastructure. Now, I am the Executive Vice President, Operations and Technology at the firm. Before my tenure at Interswitch, I had done some work at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Neptune Software](https://neptunesoftwaregroup.com/){:target="_blank"}.

### Why this blog
This blog is my platform to share insights gained through years in engineering, technology, and leadership. While the main thrust is technology, please expect occasional posts about random experiences with travel, food, or whatever else piques my interest. Whether you're an aspiring engineer or a seasoned pro, this blog is for you. Engineering and technology offer unparalleled rewards and challenges, and knowing you're not alone in the journey can make all the difference.

### Fun facts
I enjoy traveling, when I can afford it and some of the pictures you would see on this blog are from those trips. I enjoy making my own 'clear' ice and cocktail. Haven't done this in a while, but perhaps I would get inspired soon. Just recently, I got taken with Formula 1, thanks to Netflix's Drive to Survive. The passion looks like it's here to stay!

* The blog was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}. Don't ask me why I chose to punish myself. But something about opening an IDE weekly helps to keep me anchored to this tech lifeâ€¦ 
* If you want to take a peek at the source code, you can find it on my [GitHub](https://github.com/babafemio/babafemio.github.io){:target="_blank"} and hosted **free of charge** on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}. 
* The website was designed and developed mostly while listening to [Diana Ross](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE4DuJqRSfbWuZ8McRJa9mH2PJnHtfFsz&si=3_ILyQMCZNEau2NI){:target="_blank"}.
