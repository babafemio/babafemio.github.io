Every time I switch offices, I try make the next one neater by leaving behind junk from the old one or tucking them away from sight somehow in the new one. So, after a while and with many comments about the fact that I do not have paper on my desk, it does appear I have been following [Law no. 1 of the laws of simplicity](http://lawsofsimplicity.com/los/law-1-reduce.html). Reduce. Of which one of the key techniques is to ‘hide’.

I still have paper, but they are kept (…when necessary) somewhere hidden underneath the table where nobody comes around to see.

I also do the same thing on my computer desktop rather subconsciously. It’s hidden! And has been that way for years now, from laptop to laptop. And for that reason as well, I never put (or leave) any document on the desktop. No point. It’s way easier to find in a folder.

Now, I have no idea how any of this has impacted my productivity, but I can say, it looks pretty cool.
