I started out with graphics programming mostly because my initial passion for software came out of an unbridled love for computer games. Every small code I wrote had to have elements of graphics as text-based MS-DOS was very boring. Graphics in DOS was not easy, however. You had to tickle CPU registers to set the right interrupts to get the position of the mouse; fiddle with virtual memory libraries to access more than the inadequate 64kB of RAM that DOS made available.
