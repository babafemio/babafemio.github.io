On a very regular basis I engage in very tedious and tiring negotiations sessions. Many times the suppliers would come ready very early with a sweet ‘discount’ to motivate you to buy or take the deal at that particular moment. Allow me to land… Discounts are good, but what’s even better is getting a good discount for what you actually need. 

So, the next time you are in that situation you need to ask yourself “what am I buying”? and go through the invoice line by line and ask if you need that feature right now, if you would need it later or you read about it in a blog and it sounds nice. Once you have both settled and agreed on what you really need and its corresponding value to you, then begin the discount discussion. Maybe you’ll get lucky keep the same discount levels. He he.
