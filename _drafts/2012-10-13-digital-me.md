It’s one of the few holidays where I took a decision to think not about work… Meaning that I have about 10 days to faff, but it took less than a day to figure out what all that time would be spent doing. I have been doing software for a bit now and felt I could at least convince myself to employ my services to create a landing page for myself. So simple, I can do this! …and yes, also watch and record as many Bond movies as possible.

I decided to buy the babafemio.com domain! As funny as it sounds, I have not paid for a domain name before personally, as in whip out a credit card and pay, Tosin does that as I have worked through the years with product teams to create many great products that have their own domain names… Also, this used to be a long thing back in the day when I freelanced… We had to mail cash to friends in the abroad to make the payments. Now, you can use your locally issued card to do this and it’s a lot cheaper now! As a matter of fact I was having so much fun, I ended up buying about 8 domains. This holiday sha!

Ok so, buying the domain is really no good without a landing page of some sort, abi? So, I went a step further and begun to think of what my landing page would look like. While that idea marinated inside Trello, I put up a LaunchRock landing page which gave me another idea, by the way. This thing was beginning to feel like a new product. This is supposed to be a holiday, ne?

Now, where do I host this thing? The last time I bought hosting personally was in 2001 at hub.org. It was expensive at the time, but that seemed to have the best combination of what I was looking for: open source things like Apache, PHP, PostgresQL and such. You had to configure everything on your own though, SSH log in and all. Again we asked my partner’s sister in Yankee to make the credit card payment for us. Can’t even remember if we paid back… I’ll have to ask Oloks.

But things are a lot simpler now… We’ve got platforms-as-a-service offerings and one-line deploy from command prompt. I had to give it go, especially since we are working on something like this at the office. The choice was nodejitsu.com. Since Rafiki, I have been enamored with the simplicity and power of Node.js.

Of course, I could have done something with WordPress or something simple like that, I tried to do something different… Might not end up being really different, but I decided I would have a bit of fun along the way anyway. More on the ‘anatomy’ of the landing page later.

Now that babafemio.com is ready and it is quite an MVP to be proud of, I had to create this blog because the 'About Me’ was looking very lonely and I didn’t want any links that didn’t work and I had to post something so that the blog would not look under construction-ish and now I would have to keep this up and post fairly regularly.

Needless to say that at the end of my holiday, I have managed to create more work… The perils of creating a digital presence… But it could be fun.
