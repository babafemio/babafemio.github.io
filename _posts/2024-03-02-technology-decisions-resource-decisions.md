If you've been around the block in the world of engineering and technology projects, you would have undoubtedly gone through phases of those project where you obsessed over best choice of operating system, technology stack, database, etc. If you are very good at your job, you probably would have employed a more scientific approach like decision matrix that helps capture the specific benefits of each option so it is very clear how the decision is arrived at. Yet even in our most scientific endeavors, there is always an element of bias. Whether it's a fondness for the familiar or a devotion to the tech 'cult' we proudly belong to.

This is all fun and games, but sometimes what drives these decisions is a simple question of who would support the code? Or are we ready to commit to this choice? These questions change things quite significantly and you would find it all comes down to the availability of skills for the chosen technology or stack. Otherwise, that technology decision while as thorough as the process might have been would be the one thing that makes the project fail or demand a rewrite in less than 2 years.

For example, no matter how 'rapid' development in Ruby on Rails can be, you had better be sure you have access to Ruby on Rails developers to build the product and continue to support it. Even if flutter is the best multi-platform mobile development framework, it doesn't mean much unless you have a flutter developer on hand and would continue to have one to support the product for its lifetime.

Ok, maybe I am being a little melodramatic... The scientific approach works as long you ensure that one of the 'benefits' or criteria for selection of the stack or database should be the relative availability of the skills needed to build and support it. After all, it's not just about making choices; it's about making choices that stand the test of time.
