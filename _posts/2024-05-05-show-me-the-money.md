I once saw a post by a young graduate on social media asking which technology job presents the best chance of "cashing out" or "hammering..." I'd like to know if I typed that right. Essentially, he asked which part of tech would guarantee he would become rich quickly and suddenly. I wouldn't be hiring that guy.

Don't get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with wanting to make money, and lots of it. You should expect to make money. But when it becomes the sole purpose of going into tech, it may not be for you.

Today, the largest companies in the world are technology companies. TheyÂ have disrupted many industries, primarily by making processes more efficient. Nearly every business relies on technology to operate efficiently, from healthcare to finance. It is about using technology to solve real problems. As a result, the tech industry is booming, and many people are pursuing careers in this field. 

But to excel in the field, you have to have a passion for technology itself. Technology is constantly rapidly evolving, and it takes dedication and drive to keep up with this fast-paced nature of the industry. Being in tech without the ability to keep up or even the interest to do so would lead to exhaustion physically, mentally, and emotionally. 

Another crucial aspect of a successful tech career is a genuine love for problem-solving. Your customers are willing to pay for valuable solutions to their problems, and this is where your skills come in. If you excel at creating solutions, you can make a substantial income. However, it's essential to remember that this financial success should always stem from a genuine interest in serving others.

There is also a danger in overemphasizing individual gain. In an industry where collaboration is key and the best work is done in a team, focusing on personal wealth can lead to a culture of self-interest, neglecting the general good and impacting our work with others on the team.

In summary, while financial stability is a valid goal, it should not be the sole driving force behind a tech career. Those who are genuinely passionate about technology and have a genuine interest in using it to make a difference in the world are more likely to succeed in this field and make a positive impact on society.
