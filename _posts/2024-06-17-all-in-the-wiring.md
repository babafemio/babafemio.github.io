In November 2023, I found myself in a position where it appeared the most essential part of my job was to "expedite." As soon as an escalation is spotted somewhere, I get involved and request that the issue be resolved 'ASAP.'

Then, I stumbled upon the book [Wiring The Winning Organisation](https://itrevolution.com/product/wiring-the-winning-organization/){:target="_blank"}. The word 'stumble' may not be a good representation because the book would have flown into my orbit anyway. One of the authors is Gene Kim, and I have read most of his work, notably [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-phoenix-project/){:target="_blank"} and [The Unicorn Project](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-unicorn-project/){:target="_blank"}.

This discovery was timely because the book suggests that if you find yourself expediting, firefighting, or rerouting workflow, it may provide immediate gratification, but in reality, it makes matters worse. If managers had to step in to get basic requests fulfilled, we needed to be better organized or wired. I was motivated to finish the book quickly so I could get answers on how to solve this new challenge. I am leaving with you some of the key takeaways for me on how to fix the problem if you are faced with this challenge.

Find below some of the ideas I found most valuable and most accessible to implement from the book:

1. Make data relevant to the job to be done globally available. Most workflows in our teams or organizations pass information or data back and forth. These flows would not be necessary if everyone could access the same information and make the same decisions. Democratized access to data is why data-driven organizations are more efficient and outperform their peers.

2. Reorganise for more autonomy. The most time-consuming workflows are those that cross team or unit boundaries. If there are opportunities to deliver units of work within the same team, optimize for this to limit delays due to hand-offs.

3. Encourage the team to call out problems early and often. It ensures help is triggered for the right people to swarm the problem and solve it, hopefully before it becomes a real problem or, even worse, a customer escalation.


All these might sound simple enough, but they are crucial. Expect good results, but also be realistic about the outcomes. After many months of practicing all these, I still find myself expediting from time to time. But anytime I get an escalation, I treat it as a golden opportunity to understand what has gone wrong with the wiring or what is not working well. 

Happy rewiring!
