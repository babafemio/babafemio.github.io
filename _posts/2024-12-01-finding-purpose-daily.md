We all face moments when life's purpose seems to elude us, when the daily toils of existence prompt us to ask: "What is this all for?" My journey to understanding purpose came through two distinct revelations, separated by time but connected by a profound truth about why we're here.

### The traffic epiphany
I remember the moment clearly. I was sitting on my bed in my apartment in Aguda, Surulere, Lagos, when the significance of my daily routine suddenly was unclear. Each day, the same pattern would unfold: Wake up at 5 am, prepare for work, then brave the grueling hour-and-a-half traffic across Eko Bridge. I would arrive at the office, do my job, and then face the same traffic on my journey home. Then, sleep, and repeat.

The monotony of it all began to bother me deeply. As I sat there, I played this loop in my mind repeatedly. Each iteration felt more meaningless than the last. What was the point of this endless cycle? I could see this pattern stretching out before me for years to come, and the thought filled me with confusion and a deep sense of emptiness.

But then, in that moment of questioning, a revelation struck me. What if I had been looking at it all wrong? What if this daily journey wasn't just about me? What if my purpose wasn't about my own life but in the countless interactions and impact I could have on others along this seemingly mundane path?

### The Sunday School revelation
This idea of finding purpose through impact wasn't entirely new to me, though I hadn't realized it at the time. Years earlier, a seed had been planted in my consciousness during an ordinary Sunday School class. A young pastor's passionate preaching on Matthew 5:13-16 had struck a chord that would resonate through the years.

>13 “You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.

>14 “You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. 16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.


As we sat through the lengthy sermon, these phrases captured my imagination: "You are the salt of the earth" and "You are the light of the world." They offered a new perspective on sharing faith—not the typical door-to-door evangelism we were often encouraged to practice, but through the simple act of being. Being a good example. Being a light.

At first, I'll admit, it felt like I'd discovered a loophole – a way to avoid the more demanding aspects of religious practice. But the idea planted itself in my mind like a seed, taking root below the surface of my consciousness. Over the years, it grew quietly, apparently waiting for the moment when I would begin to question my purpose once again on that day in Aguda.


### The intersection of light and impact
As I reflect on both these moments of revelation, I see how they weave together into a more profound truth about purpose. That day in Lagos, frustrated by the seeming futility of my daily routine, I rediscovered what that young pastor had tried to tell us years ago: that our purpose isn't found in our daily actions themselves but in their ripple effects on others.

Just as salt enhances flavor without drawing attention to itself, and light illuminates paths without fanfare, our most significant impact often comes not from grand gestures or rigid routines but from how we move through the world. Every workplace interaction holds the potential to inspire or encourage. No matter how mundane, every moment carries the possibility of being that light that helps another find their way.

This is what I've come to understand about purpose: it's not about the path we walk but about the light we shed and the lives we touch while walking it. Whether in traffic or simply going about our daily business, our true purpose lies in our impact on others – through merely being a positive presence in their lives and to reflect God’s love and grace.

*Be the light.*
