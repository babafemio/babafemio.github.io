In our fast-paced world, it seems impossible to catch a break because there is always a new piece of technology that will change everything. Being in technology means you need to keep track of these new tools and ideas in addition to consistently performing at work day in and day out. Therefore, to prevent burnout, finding moments of rest and relaxation is essential amidst the thrill and chaos of work and daily life. As a leader, it is necessary to find opportunities to recharge; otherwise, you would be unable to help anyone or contribute where it matters. Recently, I took a short break that beautifully balanced high-energy excitement with an island escape at the end, and I am grateful and blessed to have shared these experiences with my lovely wife.

    <p>Our first stop was to see a Formula 1 race live at Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium! Attending the F1 Grand Prix for the first time was fantastic and beat all my expectations! The atmosphere was electric, with an energy that felt more like a concert or carnival, especially in the fan zone. It’s hard to imagine that some people follow this excitement around the world, visiting almost every race track during the F1 season. God when?</p>

    <p>One of the most memorable moments was watching the start of the race up to the first corner. The raw intensity of seeing the cars flying down the track and the crowd standing up to cheer as the cars went by was unforgettable. Another highlight was seeing Hamilton chase George to the very end, a tense and exciting battle that had everyone on the edge of their seats, with thunderous applause when they vroomed by. What was unexpected was the challenge with parking and traffic going into and trying to come out of the circuit after the race. That story is for another day, perhaps.</p>

After the excitement of the F1 Grand Prix at Spa, we headed to Amsterdam so I could take some meetings. During the day, we had productive meetings, and in the evenings, we took the time to unwind and explore the city. Amsterdam is a very chilled place, and we always enjoy coming here. Our hosts treated us to some fantastic cuisine, making every meal a delightful experience. One of the highlights was go-carting at the Silverstone track in Amsterdam, where I managed to snag P2—podium, baby! It was a thrill that brought back memories of the high-speed action we just witnessed at Spa. We also took a cruise on the canals, where the city’s beauty was on full display. The longer days gave us even more time to enjoy everything Amsterdam had to offer once more.

    <p>After a thrilling time in Spa and a productive yet leisurely stay in Amsterdam, Mykonos was the perfect place to unwind. The beaches in Mykonos were stunning, with clear, turquoise-blue waters that stretched as far as the eye could see. We stayed close to Elia Beach, but with so many beautiful beaches to choose from, we couldn’t resist driving around the island to explore. Each beach had its own charm, and the beach parties added an extra layer of fun to our stay.</p>

    <p>It felt like there was so much to do in Mykonos. Not sure if it was because this was our last stop or because there was actually so much to do. We explored Little Venice, with its charming and picturesque views including the old windmills. We indulged in delicious seafood and gelato—perfect treats to complement the warm, sunny days. Then we came back to Litle Venice again for more of the same.</p>

It’s easy to get swept up in work and forget to take a breather. This trip was a great reminder of how important it is to hit pause and recharge. As leaders, we need to make time for these breaks, not just for ourselves but for those who rely on us. Taking a break, having some fun, and soaking up new experiences leave you refreshed and ready to dive back into work with renewed energy and new perspectives. This trip reinforced that a bit of downtime goes a long way in keeping everything on track, both personally and professionally. The world keeps spinning, and technology keeps advancing, but sometimes, the best way to stay ahead is to take a step back, breathe, and enjoy the moment.
