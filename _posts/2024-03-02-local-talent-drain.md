I have been leading engineering and technology teams for almost two decades, and what I see as the biggest challenge facing our industry when it comes to engineering and technology talent is losing them to managerial roles (that don't allow them continue to improve their skills or practice their craft) or even worse to non-engineering/technology roles.

Imagine working with a brilliant and creative software engineer, honing his or her skills. Five years later, they then look around and discover that those they started out their careers with and have chosen to go to sales or business development have grown faster or are now earning more and have better opportunities.

Another variation of this but almost as unproductive is for the smart engineer is to grow into or accept a managerial job where available. While this might be a rewarding option for that particular engineer, but for the industry as a whole, it is still a loss because we now have one less amazing engineer. This is one less engineer that could have gone on to become a 10x developer! 

To help illuminate this problem, consider Scott Hanselman of Microsoft. He has been been a developer for 30 years and he still very much involved with the more complex .NET framework code and architecture at Microsoft. He is the VP of Developer Commnunity. He is not the CEO and he is not in a proper sales or business development role, but he speaks and engages developer all over the world. And I can imagine he is handsomely rewarded for this. Jeff Dean of Google is another name that comes to mind. He is the Chief Scientist of Google Deep Mind and Google Research, but this title masks his real value in my view. Take a closer look at the details of his LinkedIn profile and you would see that he has been involved as a 'co-designer and implementor' for most of Google's most powerful platforms. As in they probably just bring him along with all the experience he has gathered over the years along with all the experience he has gathered over the years onboard any time time they are building the next big the next big thinghing. So, armed with profiles like this, it is no wonder that organisations like Microsoft continue to build webscale products that we all consume. 

So, the question is how do we develop our own Scott Hanselmans' and Jeff Deans' so we have the experience and knowledge to build the infrastructure and platforms we desperately need in these parts? What do we do so we don't lose the experience of our best and brightest engineers? If we really hope to build platforms and systems that scale in Nigeria, we need to deal with this problem. We are already overly dependent on the developed world for our technology, our situation is now dire and we need to find a solution to the problem and there are a few ideas to consider

### Create a ladder for technical growth
There are people that love getting their hands dirty would appreciate that they can continue to do this in the organisation, continue to grow and work on more and more interesting projects. Regardless of how the organisation is structured, you can always (and should) call on your most experienced software engineers to be part of your most critical work. Even if it is just to ginger the troops and guide them along the way. And yes, it wouldn't hurt to assign that key but knotty library nobody wants to code to your 10x resource...

### Ensure engineering managers write code
Exceptional software engineering skills come from practice, and if you are not writing production code as a manager, you are not [really] practicing and as such you are not getting better at it. And the tragedy here is that it is very difficult to mentor and motivate the engineers that report to you if you are not in the game, or have not been in the game for years. And let's not forget that technology continue to change at a rapid clip, so engineers and their managers need to keep working.

### Engineering and technology employee experience
Engineering and technology talent are human too... They like to enjoy life hand have fun. Because the job is most creative in nature, the organisation needs to find ways to encourage activities that cultivate relationships within the team. In addition to this, employee experience also means to remove 'blockers'. Blockers any things in our systems mostly called processes we have added to [hopefully] address a gap or even worse, forgotten it why it exists in the first place. Remove anything that is making work difficult and yet not adding value.
